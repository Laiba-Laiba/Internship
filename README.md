TASK # 1 :
This task involves creating a console-based Login and Registration System in C++ that allows users to register and log in with their credentials, storing user information in text files. Key features include user registration, where users enter a username and password, check for existing usernames, and if unique, save the credentials in a text file, providing feedback on registration success or failure. User login allows entering and validating credentials against stored data with up to 3 login attempts, offering feedback on success or failure. The system includes an exit option for users to terminate the program. Implementation involves file handling to store user data in text files named after the username, with each file containing the username and password. The functions Existence(const string& username) checks for the existence of user files, RegisterUser() handles user registration, and LoginUser() manages user login. The main function presents a menu for users to register, log in, or exit, handling user input in a loop to allow multiple operations, demonstrating file handling, user input validation, and basic security in C++.
