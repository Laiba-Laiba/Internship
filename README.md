TASK # 1 :
This task involves creating a console-based Login and Registration System in C++ that allows users to register and log in with their credentials, storing user information in text files. Key features include user registration, where users enter a username and password, check for existing usernames, and if unique, save the credentials in a text file, providing feedback on registration success or failure. User login allows entering and validating credentials against stored data with up to 3 login attempts, offering feedback on success or failure. The system includes an exit option for users to terminate the program. Implementation involves file handling to store user data in text files named after the username, with each file containing the username and password. The functions Existence(const string& username) checks for the existence of user files, RegisterUser() handles user registration, and LoginUser() manages user login. The main function presents a menu for users to register, log in, or exit, handling user input in a loop to allow multiple operations, demonstrating file handling, user input validation, and basic security in C++.

TASK # 2 :
In Task 2, I developed a CGPA Calculator program in C++ designed to compute a student's CGPA based on multiple semesters' worth of courses and grades. The program begins by prompting the user to input the number of courses for the current semester and then iteratively collects details for each course, including the course name, grade point (on a 0.0 to 4.0 scale), and credit hours. For each semester, it calculates the total grade points and total credits, then determines the GPA for that semester by dividing the total grade points by the total credits. This information is displayed to the user, including individual course details and overall semester performance. The program also accumulates the total grade points and credits across all semesters to compute the cumulative GPA (CGPA). After displaying the CGPA, the user is asked if they wish to continue calculating for another semester. If the user chooses to continue, the process repeats; otherwise, the program terminates. This task significantly enhanced my skills in handling arrays, loops, user input, and basic arithmetic operations in C++.

TASK # 3 : 
In Task 3, I created a robust Banking System in C++ designed to manage various banking operations. The system is built around three primary classes: Customer, Transaction, and Account. The Customer class holds essential customer details like name, customer ID, and email, with constructors for initialization and file reading. The Transaction class tracks transaction specifics, including the type (Deposit, Withdrawal, Transfer), amount, and related details. The Account class maintains account information such as account number and balance, and it manages a list of transactions, providing methods to deposit and withdraw funds, add transactions, and display account balances and transaction history. The core BankingSystem class oversees customer and account management, offering functionality for adding customers, creating accounts, performing transactions, and displaying relevant details. It also handles data persistence by saving and loading customer and account information from text files. The system ensures a comprehensive approach to banking operations with user-friendly interfaces and error handling, making it a practical solution for managing banking transactions and customer information.
